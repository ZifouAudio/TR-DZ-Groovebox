**TR-DZ** is a high-performance hybrid drum machine and bass synthesizer built on the **Daisy Seed (STM32H7)** platform. It is specifically engineered for the "Zero Friction" creation of the fundamental Tech-House couple: the **Kick** and the **Bass**.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Native Sidechain (Ducking):** A real-time DSP link where the Kick envelope dynamically carves space in the Bass signal. No external compression needed.
- **Hybrid DSP Engine:** - **Kick:** Analog-modeled sine oscillator with ultra-fast exponential pitch envelopes.
    - **Bass:** Rich polyblep oscillators with resonant filters.
    - **Drums:** Dedicated Snare and Hi-Hat synthesis engines.
- **Hardware Agnostic UI:** Optimized for a **CD74HC4067** 16-channel multiplexer and **SH1106** OLED display.
- **Performance Sequencer:** 16-step grid with real-time swing and parameter control.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect your CD74HC4067 multiplexer to pins D0-D3 and A0.
2. **Library Installation:** Ensure you have the [DaisyDuino](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyDuino) library in your Arduino IDE.
3. **Flash:** Upload `TR-DZ_V11.ino` to your Daisy Seed.
4. **Play:** Start tweaking the pots to feel the native sidechain pumping.

## 📋 Roadmap

- [x] **V11:** Functional Kick/Bass engine with Native Sidechain.
- [ ] **V12:** Hysteresis implementation for stable potentiometer reading.
- [ ] **V13:** SD Card integration for sample-based percussion.
- [ ] **Future:** AI-Assisted pattern mutation (VAE models).
